Please, enter the path to your file on your hard drive,
or enter "0" to exit the program.

e.g. "C:\bookpart.log"

Enter "1", if you want to see a list of words and how often they appear in the text.
Enter "2", if you want to see how often a particular word appears in the text.

The program is case-insensitive, but does not distinguish cognates so far.
